I did my undergraduate work at [Purdue](http://www.purdue.edu/) and [Illinois](http://www.uiuc.edu/) and my graduate work at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/), [Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/), and [Texas](http://www.utexas.edu/).

I've worked at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov), [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov), and [Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics_and_Computer_Technology_Corporation).

Both of my parents were born and raised in Granada, Nicaragua. I was born in New York and grew up in Miami. My wife was born and raised in Managua, Nicaragua. She did her undergraduate work at [Tufts](http://www.tufts.edu/) and her graduate work at [Salamanca](http://www.usal.es/) and [Texas](http://www.utexas.edu/), worked at the [Vaughn Gross Center for Reading and Language Arts](http://www.meadowscenter.org/vgc/), and is now an independent consultant.
