My name is Siyuan Zhou. You can call me Scott. I a senior student at University of Washington Tacoma and major in computer science. I will be graduate in March 2016.
I love programming, it is so cool to see how I code will change the stuff behind computer and become part of it to contribute the process to evolve future technology.
I have excellent time management skill. I always got things done on time. I facilite my team mate to solve problem and meet all the design criterias.

I raised up in China and moved to Seattle when I was 18. Soon after I fail in love with this city. It is not too big and not too small.
The culture of this city dramatically attract me- a city of coffee. I start making coffee at home.

I have all different kinds of hobbies: camping, hiking, piano, gaming, board game etc... I like to meet new people, especially with like-minded people.

<h3>My goal in programming is ONLY COMPILE ONCE!</h3>
